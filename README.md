Excel File Type Comparison

Microsoft Excel three primary file types, XLSX, XLSB and the depricated XLS.  This project explores the differences in performance and file
size of these three file types.  Data was gathered by executing Excel tasks with VBA.  Time to complete execution and file sizes were saved and compared from the experimentation.

Please see the file_type_comparison.pdf file for details on the data gathered and the conclusion made.
